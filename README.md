Loan Eligibility Prediction:
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict loan eligibility for customers based on their financial and demographic data. The dataset includes various features such as income, employment status, credit score, and more. The goal is to classify each customer as eligible or ineligible for a loan, helping financial institutions make informed lending decisions.

Banking Metrics Overview
This project involves predicting loan eligibility using various banking metrics. Understanding these metrics is crucial for building effective financial models:

Asset: The total value of what a person or entity owns.
Liability: The total amount owed by a person or entity.
Disbursed Amount: The amount of money granted as a loan.
Outstanding Principal: The remaining loan amount yet to be paid, excluding interest.
Days Past Due (DPD): The number of days a loan payment is overdue.
Portfolio at Risk (PAR): The percentage of loan portfolio at risk due to late payments.
Non-Delinquent Accounts: Accounts with no overdue payments.
Standard Monitoring Account (SMA-1, SMA-2, SMA-3): Categories for loans based on overdue days, used to identify potential risks:
SMA-1: 1-30 days overdue
SMA-2: 31-60 days overdue
SMA-3: 61-90 days overdue
Written-off: Loans that are considered non-recoverable and removed from the books.
Non-Performing Assets (NPA): Loans in default or close to being in default.
Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA): The total amount of NPAs.
Net Non-Performing Assets (NNPA): GNPA minus provisions for bad debts.
These metrics are essential for analyzing customer data and making informed lending decisions.
